				<h3>Why not free?</h3>
				<p>
				Gava is a payment solution - which raises the bar up a notch user expectations wise - and the community decided this is the best approach at this phase to make sure that all the work needed done is done without any financial constraints.
				</p>

				<p>The product will work on shared hosting and bare metal servers alike with no warts, and goes just beyond the SDK, we'll be working on the integrated dashboard for phase 2 (like the Pay4App merchants dashboard) where you can log in and view transactions, resolve issues and a number of things you'd do manually otherwise.
				</p>

				<p>At some point when the community has a solid product they love, we'll open source Gava.</p>

								<h3>The problem</h3>

								<p>
								Over the course of the past year and this, several (a lot) of you have gotten in touch asking for a self-hosted version of the Pay4App gateway we ran. Basically you wanted a software solution enabling your website to accept mobile money payments on your website, withoug having to go through third parties. You gave us three reasons as to why:

								<ol>
									<li>
										You don't want a third party seating between you and the mobile network and biting into your revenue
									</li>
									<li>
										You don't have volume enough (or need) to access the mobine networks' official APIs
									</li>
									<li>
										You no longer want to manually reconcile online orders with the payments customers manually send to your phone as your customer base grows
									</li>
								</ol>
								</p>

								<p>
								So you were each looking for us to build a custom solution, or at least repackage the open source code we've been trading over email.

								We're happy to announce that we have enough pressure and interest on our part to package all the open source code into a solid product.
								</p>

								<h3>The solution</h3>

								<p>
								The checkout experience is wonderfully clean: No sign up/login, no picking a payment method, customer only provides their phone number and the app figures out the rest, full compatibility with current <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://github.com/pay4app">Pay4App plugins</a> which means plug &amp; play for most of your sites and on your technical team's side - an SDK they simply drop onto your server &amp; smartphone(s).
								</p>

								<p>
								This isn't something we weren't working on already (my GitHub <a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://github.com/ihatehandles?tab=repositories">bearing witness</a> in *part*), but as something that's only been done in reserve time (which we have little of now more than ever) - there was no ETA in sight. So we found a middle ground: Instead of paying us 4 digits worth for custom solutions as it were, we co-fund the community edition and each pay much less. This'll enable us to get hands familiar with the code on decks to finish up the work and we lead direction for the most part. There is also work outside our scope that we will have to pay for, such as design and hosting.
								</p>

								<p>
								Paying the developers a fair rate of $30/hr, we can have the product at a good stage (if not past completion) in four weeks' time, contingencies considered.

		                        	<p>Like we said before, the main components needed for this project are ALREADY there, we just need the final packaging, documentation &amp; unit testing work to be done.</p>

									<p>The other option is to pay us to do the work custom for your company specifically as most of you were requiesting, but that would take no less than the same 4 weeks (if not longer factoring in meetings) for a bill <strong>at least 32 times</strong> what we're asking for now.</p>

									<p>If you pre-order now, you get access to the product, 2x subscriptions to any and all future pro features like the dashboard, integration help on the house from me, and of course free karma bounty.</p>

									<p><strong>But most importantly</strong>, the pre-order is about getting this community project done. Alongside the SDK, we will also consolidate guides and tutorial contributions from the community (<a style="font-size: 16px" href="https://github.com/trevorsibanda/zimpayments">like Trevor's</a>) and create a central knowledge hub for local eCommerce in general. It will be a process (how to get in) and technical documentation for working with local financial service providers who have payment gateways, as well as the payment aggregators, to further market education amongst businesses and to rope in more local techies to start working with eCommerce gateways - something most dread as too complex, or insecure, and other factors which come from not having access to enough information from the companies. We won't have to write the same emails every other day.</p>

									<p>We will also publish the gateway libraries we were working on with some of you (again over email, and not-easy-to-find repositories) on the internet, to make it even faster for developers to integrate and start working with our local payment gateways. Having these tested libraries out there in a central place with documentation helps with the learning curve for developers new to local payment gateways, and to prevent them from making some costly mistakes which some of us learned the hard way- something that overally boosts confidence in local solutions and wins us mindshare against PayPal/Stripe and the like which a lot of local people still instinctively prefer over our homegrown solutions.</p>
